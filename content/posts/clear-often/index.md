When working with AI coding agents, clear the conversation often. A fresh context keeps the agent focused on your current task without baggage from earlier attempts.

{{< conversation >}}
assistant: We're running into an update error again, ahd the timestamp is stuck at to 06:00 AM. Let me try another...
interrupted Phil
user: /clear
output: (no content)
user: We have this bug: triggering an update returns an error. We've already tried the alarm clock fix and the piano lesson approach, neither worked.
assistant: I'll help you investigate the bug with a fresh start. Let me begin by reading the relevant code.
processing: ♫ I Got You Babe ♫

Without clearing, the agent may fixate on previous failed approaches or misremember what you've already tried. Start fresh, summarize what matters, and move forward.
