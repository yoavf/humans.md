When the agent fails multiple times on something trivial, stop and fix it yourself. You know how to codeâ€”make the change directly, then let the agent continue from there.

assistant: Let me update the import path.
tool: Edit(src/utils/formatter.js) fail=true
error: File does not exist
assistant: Let me try the correct path.
tool: Edit(../src/util/formatter.js) fail=true
error: File does not exist
interrupted
user: Argh, fixed it for you. The file is in lib/formatter. Can you add the error handling now?
assistant: You're absolutely right! Now I'll add the error handling.

This beats spending hours and wasting tokens on an unproductive back-and-forth. Fix it, then move forward.
